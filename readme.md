# Extracting Structured Data from Free-form Organic Synthesis Text

Organic synthesis procedures are traditionally represented by free-form texts.
This project explores how large language models can convert such unstructured
texts to structured data, so they can be used for downstream data science or machine learning
applications.

## OPENAI models

Data processing and inference scripts for OPENAI models can be found in the folder [models_openai](models_openai).
These models are fine-tuned with [300 data points](demo_apps/dash_app/assets/data1000_v2.json)
and evaluated using another set of [50 data points](demo_apps/dash_app/assets/data50_v2_test.json).

### Demo page: inferences on the test set

The app in [demo_apps/github_page](demo_apps/github_page) shows precomputed inference results from an `OPENAI davinci`
model.
It is a static page from `Dash` using
Epix Zhang's
[code](https://gist.github.com/exzhawk/33e5dcfc8859e3b6ff4e5269b1ba0ba4?permalink_comment_id=4001137),
and is synced to the [github_page](https://github.com/qai222/LLM_organic_synthesis/tree/github_pages) branch.

## Synthesis procedure data

Throughout this project, organic synthesis procedures, free text or structured, are extracted from
[the Open Reaction Database](https://docs.open-reaction-database.org/).
Related scripts can be found in the folder [ord_data](ord_data).
